We musturgently  [sense of direction; negative] scale up investments in healthy watersheds and water infrastructure, with dramatic improvements in the efficiency of water use.

And above all, we must use this year and COP26 [twenty-sixth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] in Glasgow to bend the emissions curve and create a secure foundation for water sustainability.",
